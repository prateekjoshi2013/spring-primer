- Annotating a class with both @Entity (from JPA/Hibernate) and @Data (from Lombok) can lead to unintended consequences and issues due to how Lombok generates methods and how JPA/Hibernate manages entities. 

- Here are some reasons why itâ€™s generally advised against combining these annotations:

- Reasons to Avoid Combining @Entity and @Data

    - Equals and HashCode Methods:

        - Lombok's @Data annotation generates equals and hashCode methods by default, considering all fields of the class.

        - For JPA entities, these methods should be carefully crafted because they often include relationships (like @OneToMany, @ManyToMany). 

        - Using all fields can lead to performance issues, stack overflows, or incorrect behavior when dealing with entity graphs.

    - Lazy Initialization Issues:

        - Entities with lazy-loaded fields can cause issues when equals and hashCode methods access these fields, potentially triggering unintended database loads.

    - Circular Dependencies:

        - If entities have bidirectional relationships, Lombok-generated toString methods can cause infinite recursion leading to StackOverflowError.

    - Field Access:

        - Lombok's @Data generates getters and setters for all fields. 

        - For JPA, sometimes it's preferable to have custom logic in these methods or to restrict access to certain fields.

    - Default Constructor:

        - JPA requires a no-argument constructor, which @Data provides, but it also generates it as public. 
        
        - In some cases, it is better to have a protected no-argument constructor for entities to ensure encapsulation.

- Recommended Approach

- Instead of using @Data, it's better to use specific Lombok annotations that give you more control:

- Use @Getter and @Setter for generating getters and setters.

- Use @ToString and customize it with exclude parameter to avoid circular references.

- Use @EqualsAndHashCode and customize it with exclude or by defining of to specify which fields to include.

- Use @NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor as needed.

```java
    import lombok.Getter;
    import lombok.Setter;
    import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
    import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
    import lombok.ToString;
    import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;

    import javax.persistence.Entity;
    import javax.persistence.Id;
    import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
    import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
    import javax.persistence.OneToMany;
    import java.util.Set;

    @Entity
    @Getter
    @Setter
    @NoArgsConstructor
    @AllArgsConstructor
    @ToString(exclude = "relatedEntities")
    @EqualsAndHashCode(of = "id")
    public class MyEntity {

        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        private Long id;

        private String name;

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "myEntity")
        private Set<RelatedEntity> relatedEntities;
    }
```
